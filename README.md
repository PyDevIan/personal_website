# Personal Website – Ioannis Tsioukis (aka PyDevIan)

Welcome to the source code of my personal website!

🔗 **Live site:** [https://pydevian.github.io/personal_website/](https://pydevian.github.io/personal_website/)

This website serves as my digital presence, where I share my background, technical expertise, ongoing projects, and personal journey in AI, data science, and machine learning. It also includes a curated knowledge hub of what I’m learning, building, and planning
